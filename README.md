# Duplicate-Question-NLP
The "Duplicate Question Pairs" task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves determining whether two questions have the same meaning, even if they are phrased differently. The goal is to identify semantic equivalence, not just word-for-word similarity.

## Project Features

- **Semantic Equivalence Detection:** Uses NLP models to determine if a pair of questions are duplicates.
- **Jupyter Notebook Implementation:** Main workflow and experiments are provided as notebooks.
- **Preprocessing Pipelines:** Includes text cleaning, tokenization, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Covers various machine learning models for duplicate detection.
